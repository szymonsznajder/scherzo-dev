# Content Dashboard Guide

This dashboard helps you keep track of your published pages.  It provides a quick overview of each page's status, making it easy to see what needs attention.

## Key Features

* **Visual Status:**  Each page is color-coded:

* **Sorting:**  Organize the list alphabetically by title, or by date (oldest/newest).
* **Preview Images:**  Hover your mouse over a page's link to see a preview (if available).
* **Mobile-Friendly:** The layout automatically adjusts to fit your screen, whether you're using a computer, tablet, or phone.
